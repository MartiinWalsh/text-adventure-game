  storyText: 'You run down a long corridor then up a flight of metal stairs. They
    make a loud racket as you clamber up them. Thank goodness the machinery in this
    place is so loud.

    

    In front of you is the emergency exit door. It
    has an oversized, cast iron lock hanging from a bolted handle. You could try
    picking the lock, or maybe look for a way to pry it off.

    

    What to
    do?

    

    1. Pick it.

    2. Pry it.'
