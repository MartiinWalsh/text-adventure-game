    Bit
    tough to hear yourself think above the thumping machinery. However, in front
    of you is the emergency exit door. It has an oversized, cast iron lock hanging
    from a bolted handle. You could try picking the lock, or maybe look for a way
    to pry it off.

    1. Pick it.

    2. Pry
    it.'
